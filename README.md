#Defination:

Data types are a classification of data which tell the compiler or interpreter how the programer intends use the data.

#importance of Data types in programming

Explanation:
.Data types ensure that data is stored in an efficent way.
. They helping in programming correct operations on data.
.Proper use of data types can prevent errors and bugs in the program.


Video Outline;
1. Introduction of Datatype in Programming.
2. Importance of Datatypes in Programming.
3. Basic of Datatypes.
    * Integer (1,2,3,4,5,6)
    * Floating-point numbers(5.6,3.5,6.1,5.1)
    * String ("sohit",'Paras')
    * Bolleans(TRUE OR FALSE)

4. Advance of Datatypes
    * List             Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * Tuples           Example: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    * Sets             Example: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    * Dictonaries      Example: {1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c", 4: "d", 5: "e"}
